          <p>
            I am driven by a profound passion for the intersection of creativity and technology. My artisitc journey has led me to a captivating realm where code breathes life into interactive websites, <a class = "links" href = "library.html">vibrant images</a>, and <a class = "links" href = "library.html">immersive games</a>, all rooted in the rich tapestry of experiences unique to people of color. Recently, I've embarked on a thrilling discovery that coding can be a bridge to diverse art forms, from captivating digital paintings to dynamic data visualizations. This explorations is not just a technical pursuit; it's a creative odyssey that seeks to connect, empower, and inspire. <br> <br>
            
At the heart of my artistic mission lies the desire to infuse joy, vitality, and authenticity into my creations. I believe that art has the power to transform, uplift, and illuminate, and I want my work to be a testament to this potential. In every project, I endeavor to weave together elements that resonate deeply with minority communities, forging connections that transcend boundaries and amplify voices that have often been marginalized. <br> <br>
            
My creative process is driven by a commitment to breaking free from constraints and limitations. I see the fusion of media and computer science/coding not as separate entities but as powerful tools for innovation. As I continue to explore this synergy, my goal is to showcase the boundless possiblities it offers, both as a medium for artistic expression and as a force for social change.
